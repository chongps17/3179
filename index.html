    <h1>Australian Bushfires</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class = "two-grid">
            <p>Due to Australia's geographical location, bushfires have become a prominent issue for Australians and the environment. These bushfires not 
              only put the lives of Australians at risk but cause severe damage to Australia's wildlife and natural landscapes. This visualisation aims to explore 
              the geographical location of fires across Australia, the characteristics of these fires and how they affect aspects of our environment such as our forests 
              and water quality. </p>

        <h2>Fires detected across Australia</h2>
        <div id = "dotmap" class = "chart" style = "text-align: center;"></div>
        <div class = "two-grid">
          <p>This map details the location of fires across Australia, with <strong>brightness</strong> indicating the temperature of the fire and 
            <strong>Fire Radiative Power (FRP)</strong> indicating the intensity of the fire based on satellite signals. 
            The time frame of fires shown on the map can be adjusted using the date brushing feature in the bar graph.</p>
          
          <p>The overall map shows that the majority of fires happen near the coast of Australian states with 
            a particular density in Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory. The bar graph also shows that the highest 
            number of fires country-wide is around the <strong>first half of September</strong> in the data set which may be a result of 
            seasonal changes.</p>

      <h2>Day vs night fires</h2>

      <div class = "two-grid">
          <div>
            <p>
              Day time fires make up most reported fires in Australia, making up <strong>78.32%</strong> of fires recorded in the data set while nighttime fires only make up <strong>21.68%</strong>. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on the scatterplot, there is a general trend that daytime fires have a higher intensity (FRP) and temperature (brightness) compared to nighttime fires. 
              This may be the case as temperatures tend to peak during the day, resulting in higher temperature and intensity. 
            </p>

        <h2>Proportion of forested areas in fires</h2>
        <div class = "two-grid">

                <p>
                   Bushfires cause severe damage to Australia's natural ecosystems and wildlife. The proportion of forest to non-forest areas involved in bushfires varies from state to state. Based on the proportional chart, 
                   <strong>Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria</strong> have the 
                   highest proportion of forest area burnt in fires recorded between 2019-2020. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  These four Australian states have had <strong>90% or more</strong>
                  of their forested areas burnt while states such as South Australia have a lower proportion.

        <h2>The environmental impact of bushfires on aquatic habitats</h2>
        <div class = "two-grid">
          <div>
            <div id = "area1" class = "chart"></div>
          </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            During bushfires, the oxygen level in bodies of water tend to drop from ashes and other burning materials entering the water.  
          </p>

          <p>
            Using Lake Conjola in New South Wales as an example, the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels <strong>fluctate</strong> throughout 
            the time of recording, going as low as around <strong>6 mg/L</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Low oxygen levels can pose harm to aquatic species and cause instability in their environment. Oxygen levels also impact bateria and algae growth which are key
            parts of aquatic ecosystems.
          </p>

        </div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <div class = "two-grid">

        <div>
          <p>
            In addition to fluctuating oxygen levels, bushfires also impact the temperature of bodies of water as a result of excess heat from the fire.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to the fluctuating oxygen levels, the example of Lake Conjola in New South Wales shows a <strong>steady</strong> increase in temperature, with 
            temperatures of around <strong>25°C</strong> at the beginning of recording to a peak of around <strong>29°C</strong>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In the long term, increases in water temperature can also pose <strong>severe harm</strong> to aquatic species as even an incremental change can impact the livability of the
            ecosystem which is especially the case for less heat-tolerant species within the water.
